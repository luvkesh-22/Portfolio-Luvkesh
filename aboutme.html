        <h2>Hey! I am Luvkesh Bhardwaj</h2>
        <p>
          I am a Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) graduate from Bhai Parmanand DSEU with a strong interest in
          web development, backend technologies, and building practical digital solutions. Alongside my technical
          journey, I have actively taken up leadership roles and responsibilities that shaped my communication,
          planning, and problem-solving abilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the last three years, I have been deeply involved in student-led initiatives, serving in multiple
          positions including President of the Literary Society, Placement Cell Coordinator, and mentor for the Sports
          Club. I have organized large-scale university events, industry webinars, and academic seminars, and worked
          closely with teams and professionals to ensure successful execution.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe in learning by doing. Through projects, virtual internships, and certifications, I continuously
          work on improving my technical foundation while maintaining a strong focus on teamwork, leadership, and
          real-world impact.
